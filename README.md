<h2>Idea of Project</h2> 
RecruitRush is a dynamic platform tailored to address the urgent needs of students facing last-minute placement interviews. With its innovative approach, RecruitRush aims to expedite and enhance the preparation process, offering targeted resources and support to students on the brink of their interviews.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

In the rush to prepare for last-minute placement interviews, students face the challenge of effectively assessing their knowledge, identifying areas for improvement, and integrating preparation for aptitude, coding, and interview skills. This urgency often leads to fragmented preparation efforts, leaving students unsure of their readiness and lacking a cohesive strategy to address all aspects of the interview process.

<h2>Solution</h2>
RecruitRush offers a comprehensive solution by providing quick access to aptitude tests, coding challenges, and interview simulations. Through these resources, students can efficiently assess their skills, pinpoint weaknesses, and refine their aptitude, coding, and interview techniques. By streamlining the preparation process, RecruitRush enhances students' readiness for interviews, enabling them to tackle placement opportunities with confidence, even when time is limited. Our solution is in the form of a <b>Web-Application</b>
